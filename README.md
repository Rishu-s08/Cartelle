## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rishu-s08/cartelle.git
cd cartelle

Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your Google API key:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here

### 3. Access API Key in Flutter

```dart
import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';

void main() async {
  await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env");
  final googleApiKey = dotenv.env['GOOGLE_API_KEY'];
  runApp(MyApp(googleApiKey: googleApiKey));
}
```
